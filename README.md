# Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Level-Prediction
Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction is a competition hosted on Kaggle.com. This repository contains various approaches used to predict the poverty levels in Costa Rica. 

The Inter-American Development Bank is asking the Kaggle community for help with income qualification for some of the world's poorest families. 

Here's the backstory: Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.  In Latin America, one popular method uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. It’s called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT). With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need.  While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.
